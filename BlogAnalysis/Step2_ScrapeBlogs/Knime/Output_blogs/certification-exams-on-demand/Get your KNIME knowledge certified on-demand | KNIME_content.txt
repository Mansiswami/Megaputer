And earn a digital badge
Have you been learning about data science and KNIME and want to take one of the examinations in the KNIME Certification Program? Get your expertise certified by taking an on-demand examination, whenever you consider yourself ready.
The on-demand certification exams can be accessed via the same learning platform that hosts all our educational materials. This puts all the e-learning materials you need to prepare for the exams as well as the examinations themselves in a single, convenient location. Full details about the on-demand exams are on the KNIME Certification Program page.
Tip: Browse our catalog of free KNIME Self-Paced Courses. Choose which one you would like to take and then login and enroll for the course on the learning platform.
The change to on-demand examinations also comes with a more state-of-the-art way of receiving certificates: Instead of sending out just a PDF certificate (that cannot readily be verified), you will be issued a digital badge for each examination that you pass.
Share your badges on social media or add them to your LinkedIn account and increase your chances of being noticed within your network by peers and potential employers. Add a link to your badge in your CV and provide future employers with verifiable proof of your skills. Indeed, the digital badge is not merely a graphical representation but also contains verified metainformation (such as date of issue and expiration date).
If you already have a KNIME account*, you are all set: Head over to the KNIME Certification Program page and purchase your ticket for an examination. When the email address associated with your account has also been used to register for previous exams, you’ll automatically be unlocked for the next levels of certification (if not, please reach out to us at certification@knime.com).
*And if you don’t already have a KNIME account, head over to our Create Account page to create one.
