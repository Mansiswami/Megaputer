Introduction Today customers want to reduce manual operations for deploying and maintaining their infrastructure. The recommended method to deploy and manage infrastructure on AWS is to follow Infrastructure-As-Code (IaC) model using tools like AWS CloudFormation, AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) or Terraform. One of the critical components in terraform is managing the state file which […]
AWS CodePipeline is a managed continuous delivery service that automates your release pipelines for application and infrastructure updates. Today, CodePipeline adds triggers and new execution modes to support teams with various delivery strategies. These features give customers more choice in the pipelines they build. In this post, I am going to show you how to […]
A Case Study Presented by CodeWhisperer Customizations Amazon CodeWhisperer is an AI-powered coding assistant that is trained on a wide variety of data, including Amazon and open-source code. With the launch of CodeWhisperer Customizations, customers can create a customization resource. The customization is produced by augmenting CodeWhisperer using a customer’s private code repositories. This enables […]
AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables customers to manage, model, and provision infrastructure at scale. You can declare your infrastructure as code in YAML or JSON by using AWS CloudFormation, in a general purpose programming language using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), or visually using Application Composer. IaC configurations can then be audited and […]
Today we’re excited to announce the general availability of CDK Migrate, a component of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). This feature enables users to migrate AWS CloudFormation templates, previously deployed CloudFormation stacks, or resources created outside of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) into a CDK application. This feature is being launched in tandem with the […]
Recently, we launched a new AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) construct for Amazon DynamoDB tables, known as TableV2. This construct provides a number of new features in addition to what the original construct offered, enabling CDK authors to create global tables, simplifying the configuration of global secondary indexes and auto scaling, as well as supporting […]
Announced by Werner Vogels in his 2023 re:Invent Keynote, Generative AI CDK Constructs, an open-source extension of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), provides well-architected multi-service patterns to quickly and efficiently create repeatable infrastructure required for generative AI projects on AWS. Our initial release includes five CDK constructs enabling key generative AI capabilities like […]
This post demonstrates using AWS CloudFormation StackSets to deploy CloudFormation Hooks from a centralized delegated administrator account to all accounts within an Organization Unit(OU). It provides step-by-step guidance to deploy controls at scale to your AWS Organization as Hooks using StackSets. By following this post, you will learn how to deploy a hook to hundreds […]
Code coverage is a code quality metric leveraging unit tests. Coming up with test cases with every combination of parameters requires developer’s time, which is already scarce. Developers’ focus is (mis)directed at just meeting the coverage threshold. In doing so, quality of code may be compromised and resulting code may still result in unexpected outcomes. […]
The dust has settled after another re:Invent. I once again had the privilege of organizing the DevOps and Developer Productivity (DOP) track along with Jessie VanderVeen, Anubhav Rao and countless others. For 2022, the DOP track included 59 sessions.  If you weren’t able to attend, I have compiled a list of the on-demand sessions for […]
