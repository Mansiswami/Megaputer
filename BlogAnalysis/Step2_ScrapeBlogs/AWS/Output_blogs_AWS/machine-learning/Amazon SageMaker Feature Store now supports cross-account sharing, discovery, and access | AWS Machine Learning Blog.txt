Amazon SageMaker Feature Store is a fully managed, purpose-built repository to store, share, and manage features for machine learning (ML) models. Features are inputs to ML models used during training and inference. For example, in an application that recommends a music playlist, features could include song ratings, listening duration, and listener demographics. Features are used repeatedly by multiple teams, and feature quality is critical to ensure a highly accurate model. Also, when features used to train models offline in batch are made available for real-time inference, it’s hard to keep the two feature stores synchronized. SageMaker Feature Store provides a secured and unified store to process, standardize, and use features at scale across the ML lifecycle.
SageMaker Feature Store now makes it effortless to share, discover, and access feature groups across AWS accounts. This new capability promotes collaboration and minimizes duplicate work for teams involved in ML model and application development, particularly in enterprise environments with multiple accounts spanning different business units or functions.
With this launch, account owners can grant access to select feature groups by other accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). After they’re granted access, users of those accounts can conveniently view all of their feature groups, including the shared ones, through Amazon SageMaker Studio or SDKs. This enables teams to discover and utilize features developed by other teams, fostering knowledge sharing and efficiency. Additionally, usage details of shared resources can be monitored with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail. For a deep dive, refer to Cross account feature group discoverability and access.
In this post, we discuss the why and how of a centralized feature store with cross-account access. We show how to set it up and run a sample demonstration, as well as the benefits you can get by using this new capability in your organization.
Organizations need to securely share features across teams to build accurate ML models, while preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. SageMaker Feature Store now allows granular sharing of features across accounts via AWS RAM, enabling collaborative model development with governance.
SageMaker Feature Store provides purpose-built storage and management for ML features used during training and inferencing. With cross-account support, you can now selectively share features stored in one AWS account with other accounts in your organization.
For example, the analytics team may curate features like customer profile, transaction history, and product catalogs in a central management account. These need to be securely accessed by ML developers in other departments like marketing, fraud detection, and so on to build models.
The following are key benefits of sharing ML features across accounts:
In the realm of machine learning, the feature store acts as a crucial bridge, connecting those who supply data with those who harness it. This dichotomy can be effectively managed using a cross-account setup for the feature store. Let’s demystify this using the following personas and a real-world analogy:
Data engineers serve as architects sketching the initial blueprint. Their task is to construct and oversee efficient data pipelines. Drawing data from source systems, they mold raw data attributes into discernable features. Take “age” for instance. Although it merely represents the span between now and one’s birthdate, its interpretation might vary across an organization. Ensuring quality, uniformity, and consistency is paramount here. Their aim is to feed data into a centralized feature store, establishing it as the undisputed reference point.
ML engineers refine these foundational features, tailoring them for mature ML workflows. In the context of banking, they might deduce statistical insights from account balances, identifying trends and flow patterns. The hurdle they often face is redundancy. It’s common to see repetitive feature creation pipelines across diverse ML initiatives.
Imagine data scientists as gourmet chefs scouting a well-stocked pantry, seeking the best ingredients for their next culinary masterpiece. Their time should be invested in crafting innovative data recipes, not in reassembling the pantry. The hurdle at this juncture is discovering the right data. A user-friendly interface, equipped with efficient search tools and comprehensive feature descriptions, is indispensable.
In essence, a cross-account feature store setup meticulously segments the roles of data producers and consumers, ensuring efficiency, clarity, and innovation. Whether you’re laying the foundation or building atop it, knowing your role and tools is pivotal.
The following diagram shows two different data scientist teams, from two different AWS accounts, who share and use the same central feature store to select the best features needed to build their ML models. The central feature store is located in a different account managed by data engineers and ML engineers, where the data governance layer and data lake are usually situated.

With SageMaker Feature Store, you can share feature group resources across accounts. The resource owner account shares resources with the resource consumer accounts. There are two distinct categories of permissions associated with sharing resources:
The following example diagram visualizes sharing the SageMaker catalog resource type granting the discoverability permission vs. sharing a feature group resource type entity with access permissions. The SageMaker catalog contains all of your feature group entities. When granted a discoverability permission, the resource consumer account can search and discover all feature group entities within the resource owner account. A feature group entity contains your ML data. When granted an access permission, the resource consumer account can access the feature group data, with access determined by the relevant access permission.

Complete the following steps to securely share features between accounts using SageMaker Feature Store:
Developers in target accounts can now retrieve shared features using the SageMaker SDK, join with additional data, and use them to train ML models. The source account can monitor access to shared features by all accounts using CloudTrail event logs. Audit logs provide centralized visibility into feature usage.
With these steps, you can enable teams across your organization to securely use shared ML features for collaborative model development.
We assume that you have already created feature groups and ingested the corresponding features inside your owner account. For more information about getting started, refer to Get started with Amazon SageMaker Feature Store.
First, we demonstrate how to share our SageMaker Feature Store catalog in the owner account. Complete the following steps:
Now the shared SageMaker Feature Store catalog should show up on the Resource shares page.

You can achieve the same result by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) with the following command (provide your AWS Region, owner account ID, and consumer account ID):
To accept the resource share invite, complete the following steps:
You can achieve the same result using the AWS CLI with the following command:
From the output of preceding command, retrieve the value of resourceShareInvitationArn and then accept the invitation with the following command:
The workflow is the same for sharing feature groups with another account via AWS RAM.
After you share some feature groups with the target account, you can inspect the SageMaker Feature Store, where you can observe that the new catalog is available.

With access permissions, we can grant permissions at the feature group resource level. Complete the following steps:
Now the shared catalog should show up on the Resource shares page.

You can achieve the same result by using the AWS CLI with the following command (provide your Region, owner account ID, consumer account ID, and feature group name):
There are three types of access that you can grant to feature groups:
To accept the resource share invite, complete the following steps:
The process of accepting the resource share using the AWS CLI is the same as for the previous discoverability section, with the get-resource-share-invitations and accept-resource-share-invitation commands.
Two notebooks were added to the SageMaker Feature Store Workshop GitHub repository in the folder 09-module-security/09-03-cross-account-access:
The first script shows how to create the discoverability resource share for existing feature groups at the admin or owner account and share it with another consumer account programmatically using the AWS RAM API create_resource_share(). It also shows how to grant access permissions to existing feature groups at the owner account and share these with another consumer account using AWS RAM. You need to provide your consumer AWS account ID before running the notebook.
The second script accepts the AWS RAM invitations to discover and access cross-account feature groups from the owner level. Then it shows how to discover cross-account feature groups that are on the owner account and list these on the consumer account. You can also see how to access in read/write cross-account feature groups that are on the owner account and perform the following operations from the consumer account: describe(), get_record(), ingest(), and delete_record().
The SageMaker Feature Store cross-account capability offers several compelling benefits. Firstly, it facilitates seamless collaboration by enabling sharing of feature groups across multiple AWS accounts. This enhances data accessibility and utilization, allowing teams in different accounts to use shared features for their ML workflows.
Additionally, the cross-account capability enhances data governance and security. With controlled access and permissions through AWS RAM, organizations can maintain a centralized feature store while ensuring that each account has tailored access levels. This not only streamlines data management, but also strengthens security measures by limiting access to authorized users.
Furthermore, the ability to share feature groups across accounts simplifies the process of building and deploying ML models in a collaborative environment. It fosters a more integrated and efficient workflow, reducing redundancy in data storage and facilitating the creation of robust models with shared, high-quality features. Overall, the Feature Store’s cross-account capability optimizes collaboration, governance, and efficiency in ML development across diverse AWS accounts.
