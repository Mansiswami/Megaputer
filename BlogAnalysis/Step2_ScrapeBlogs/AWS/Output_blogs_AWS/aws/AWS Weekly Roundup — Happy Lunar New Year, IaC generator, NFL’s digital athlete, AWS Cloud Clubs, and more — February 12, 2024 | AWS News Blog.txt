Last Week‚Äôs Launches Here are some launches that got my attention:
A new Local Zone in Houston, Texas ‚Äì Local Zones are an AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to large population, industry, and IT centers where no AWS Region exists. AWS Local Zones are available in the US in 15 other metro areas and globally in an additional 17 metros areas, allowing you to deliver low-latency applications to end users worldwide. You can enable the new Local Zone in Houston (us-east-1-iah-2a) from the Zones tab in the Amazon EC2 console settings.

AWS CloudFormation IaC generator ‚Äì You can generate a template using AWS resources provisioned in your account that are not already managed by CloudFormation. With this launch, you can onboard workloads to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in minutes, eliminating weeks of manual effort. You can then leverage the IaC benefits of automation, safety, and scalability for the workloads. Use the template to import resources into CloudFormation or replicate resources in a new account or Region. See the user guide and blog post to learn more.

Along with the infrastructure pricing for on-demand, we are also reducing the minimum billing duration for Windows containers to 5 minutes (from 15 minutes) for any Fargate Windows tasks starting February 1st, 2024 (12:00am UTC).

Amazon Data Firehose is the easiest way to capture, transform, and deliver data streams into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Splunk, Snowflake, and other 3rd party analytics services. The name change is effective in the AWS Management Console, documentations, and product pages.
