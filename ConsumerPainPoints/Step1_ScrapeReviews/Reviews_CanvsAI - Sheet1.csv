"Canvs AI allows me and our research team to mine open-end verbatims in our surveys. The summary graphs are nice as you can very easily see what themes are most talked about, but it is the ability to slice and dice by different demographics or cohorts that really brings our other data to life.",I would love to be able to understand more how different themes are related to each other. Perhaps some sort of spider diagram.,"As you can imagine, we sometimes collect up to 1,000 verbatims in a single open text box within a survey. Scanning through all of those manually would be extremely burdensome and not very productive. Canvs AI does all the heavy lifting for us and then allows us to dig deeper by different cuts to really bring to life the quantitative data we have in our reports. ."

There are also many different views/graphics that I can use of the data to provide to clients.,"There is a bit of a learning curve to the platform and tool.

"The most helpful part of Canvs AI, for me, has been the story assist feature. It has been very helpful pulling out broad themes and providing summaries of open-ended responses.

The ability to review sentiment for campaign posts without needing influencers to sign in to the platform itself.,None for now. All systems are flawless. Start up time can be reduced a bit and memory utilization as well,"Canvs allows us to provide sentiment analysis reporting and measurement to our clients. We like that we're able to make custom categories based on the client's specific details (ie. look for the client's name in comments). We're also able to provide positive, negative and neutral sentiment analysis to determine the impact of a campaign. Most sentiment analysis tools require you to sign in from the account that you are analyzing. The benefit of Canvs is that you can upload all the comments and not have a requirement to login. This is especially useful when analyzing an influencer program. ."
"Instead of just getting the boring old coded open ends, Canvs AI helps you dig even deeper into these codes and truly understand the message behind the codes.

It also lets you analyze a lot of data in a short amount of time.,"Some features are not the most user-friendly, but there aren't too many pain points once the little nuances are figured out. For example, to filter for specific posts, at the Campaign level, it's done through the calendar view, not a separate filter.",It is allowing me to analyze data more quickly and also dive deeper into data. It helps me see themes that I might not have been able to find on my own .

We use Canvs primarily for sentiment analysis. This tool allows us to analyze sentiment on dark posts (which aren't typically available elsewhere) and on TikTok!,I wish it were a bit easier to pull specific representative quotes along with identifiers (e.g. age and gender) to help with reporting. I also wish the story assist feature gave a little more information regarding response salience so that we don't accidentally overstate the prevelance of some sentiments.,"Canvs helps our Insights and Analytics team prepare and present in-depth campaign reports for our partners.

It does a great job of categorizing responses accurately and makes it easy to see what's included in each category. It also allows you to quickly and easily group similar categories together or tag as you please.,"Overall, a very well-integrated great tool has not found any downside yet.",It's automatically helping us code verbatim open-ends without having to spend the time looking through them one by one and categorize them manually.

"Canvs takes into account the nuances of slang, entertainment-specific phrasing, and emoji behavior of social media for text analysis, resulting in a much more accurate experience than traditional social listening competitors that are not specialized for entertainemnt listening. Adding to that, its open-ended text analysis product, where one can upload text from surveys and other sources, increases its utility.","Canvs currently, as of this review, lacks non-English text analysis, which could be limiting for global work.","It speeds up the open-end analysis process, freeing up my time for more strategic work rather than going through open-ends to find themes. ."

This feature is particularly useful for businesses like us who are looking to understand their audience's sentiments.",As such nothing but I think the model needs to learn more and can get better with more data flowing. Else it's perfect in terms of understanding sentiments. A slight improvement in support will be helpful.,"It helps businesses to understand the sentiments and get insights from them and it helps to make emotional data-driven decisions like humans. Best part it you can analyze text, social campaigns, and OTT content too. ."
Canvas AI's filters are excellent for finding answers based on subjects and emotions. It helps me save time when analyzing open ended responses and provides accurate perceptions of participants feelings.,"It is unfortunate that Canvs AI does not include bulk data analysis feature.

The accuracy of the sentiment classification is the best I've seen.,I have to manually collect and input comments when analyzing social conversation.,The sentiment classification is terrible in Brandwatch. Canvs helps provide more accurate sentiment. .

Also, with Canvas you can now get the sentiment in OEs which is great, our clients like the read on emotional and traditional comments. It adds more ""qualitative"" insights to the quantitative data.","Honestly, I have not found anything I truly dislike. When I have suggestions for improvement, the Canvas team listens and works to make it better.","Canvas AI is making it possible for us to have more OEs in our quantitative studies since it is more affordable for coding.

"1. Canvs has a great AI on its own that is always improving. However, the ability to write rules using easily understandable boolean logic allows the feedback to be categorized exactly the way you want with high accuracy all in one elegant formula.",there isn't anything i dislike. the AI platform and team are great,"Canvs provides our 'why' behind the score better than other text analytic tools in the industry. The amount of manual work this tool saves our company is invaluable. Canvs paints a picture of our customer's voice allowing us to visualize the level of impact a 'code' may be having on the company, region, call center, product, etc. We can better coach our associates, understand customer challenges by segment, and get to the bottom of issues quickly and at a high level without sacrificing the details found in reading open ends. ."
Hugely efficient and it goes way beyond sentiment into advanced emotion analysis. The team are excellent to work with. The platform is continually developing e.g. auto-translation,"The AI needs a lot of help to truly understand what customers are saying (especially if you are not in one of a dozen or so pre-selected industries that Canvs has tailored their AI toward). Canvs gives you the ability to write rules, but this functionality is a little clunky. For starters, you can write rules when looking at a dataset and it will automatically apply those rules, BUT... once a rule is written, any edits made to it will not be applied to the current dataset. So then you have to contact Canvs support to delete out that dataset and the re-upload the dataset (waiting the 10-20 minutes for Canvs to analyze) and then apply the rules again. As you can imagine, this is a little painful because you may have to do this several or more times before you get the rules the way they need to be. Beyond this issue, I've discovered that some of the rules aren't even catching some of the items they are meant to. I know that an AI can't be perfect, but some of the topics, nets &amp; codes that Canvs creates or leaves off also are hard to overlook.","It enables me to analyse unstructured data/text quickly and cost-efficiently and with a clear and easy to interpret output/insight report that is actionable. The flexibility of the platforms means I can do simple/quick analysis or more complex analysis for tracking. With the auto-translate option, text from multiple languages can now be uploaded and easily translated and analysed - a real-time saver. ."
"The ""Highlights"" Canvs gives based on the data/filters you set is probably my favorite part. With the right filters Canvs can quickly tell you ""Florida had 5x more *comment topic* than the average of all other states"". Canvs is also pretty quick. If you are someone who doesn't have time for comment coding, this is a great tool because almost every file I've uploaded, Canvs has analyzed within 10-20 minutes. The people I've worked with at Canvs have been super kind &amp; willing to help. Canvs is always working to make their tool better.","There isn't much I dislike from what I have used! Perhaps some of the tags can be a bit unclear on why they decided on certain theme assignments. But other than that, no issues!","Currently, our customers are self-selecting the reasons why they gave us a certain NPS prior to then giving us their comments. We originally were attracted to Canvs for the emotional state application, to add that extra level of insight. Canvs has also helped me identify some correlations that I may not have seen on my own. ."
"I really like the ability to upload large amounts of open-ends and have it sort into response types (excited, happy, dislike, etc) which makes it easy to find the exact OE needed.",The reading of customer emotions isn't the best feature. It still has a lake of ability,"We don't have a ton of time to spend going through open-ends for presentations, so Canvs AI makes it much easier to find the quotes we need for our specific reports. ."
the comprehensive analysis of social media conversation,maybe missing some integrations. but overall it was great.,Understand the audience awareness of the brand .
I used this tool to build hypothesis about our users' behaviour,"Sometimes the shows don't have consistent naming. For example,The Oscars are under that name one year whereas a different year they're under the Academy Awards, so it can be confusing what needs to be typed in.",analysing our users' feedback and their processing .
The interface is easy to learn and use. I like being able to see sentiment when looking at shows and what drives that.,Could be more better and automatically suggest,Canvs helps us see how the audience is reacting to big award shows and seeing what talent drove positive sentiment. .
Ease of use and at the right place of usage,"Sometimes the program can take a long time to run text analysis, so it is hard to plan your work day around. Will it take 30 minutes or 4 hours? (I know file size effects this, but still struggle to gauge the time)",Graphic design .
"I love how easy it is to navigate the platform, especially for beginners.","Canvs can be a little frustrating when (in my business) a lot of the data is bucketed into generic topics, like ""film"" or ""nothing"". Canvs has also gone through a lot of changes recently that aren't that easy to keep up with on your own or are super intuitive.",It is helping my team gain an understanding of open end responses much faster and connect some emotions to the responses. .
"Canvs makes analyzing a lot of data quick and easy. The ability of Canvs to ""bucket"" things by real-world language is super helpful.","I have no problems with Canvas AI, it's such a great application to pull information from!","We receive thousands of open-end responses and it would take a lot of time, effort, and money to try and analyze them manually. Canvs allows us to quickly find trends, issues, or benefits to help market a product. ."
"I love how Canvs AI helps me understand what consumers are enjoying with the shows I'm creating analytics for. I also love how the application is easy to use, I had no issues getting used to working with it.",I dislike that we are limited to 50 columns of data. I could use even more.,Canvs AI has helped my job understand what content fans would like from their favorite shows. The application helps us understand what fans liked/ talked about the most from episodes and more. That data has allowed us to make engaging posts for our audience! .
"Canvs gives you insights at your fingertips, analyzing how consumer verbatims fit into a larger quantitative dataset. I love the highlights feature that helps extract meaningful tidbits of information to help build a story around the data.",I wish the text analytics were more nuanced but it gets me more than halfway there so it's good enough. The ability to filter for a longer date range for video assets on YouTube is also next to impossible.,"Canvs AI helps solidify the story behind the data in my mind so I can create better outputs for my clients. My clients love the information that Canvs AI makes very accessible to me. Crosstabs in a cinch, Boolean logic to filter, it's a great platform! ."
"The text analytics and topic breakdown are among the best for entertainment purposes, like for movies and shows, in the industry. I also enjoy the ability to quickly look at any given show, movie, or video asset on YouTube and see how well or not well it's being recieved. All of this coupled with the ability to share dashboards without logins required saves me a lot of time.",They have been improving their testing environment,"It helps solve ""sentiment"" related questions and gives me the ability to quickly create benchmarks and compare against other movies and shows, regardless of which company they are from. The open-ended text analytic tool is also extremely helpful for quickly understanding survey responses. ."
Our Canvs AI API integration enables us to give our customers actionable insights by creating SMS Surveys within our application,"Sometimes it doesn't capture the nuances in the language and the coding ultimately isn't that helpful for our purposes, which is identifying common themes.",Provide our customers a way to analyze open ends from SMS surveys the send their consumer .
"Getting a big picture view of large open-end data sets. We use it almost exclusively to analyze open-end responses in surveys, and when there's a lot to go through it's much easier to do it through Canvs.",I didn't dislike anything. I really liked how user friendly it was. There wasn't anything that I didn't like.,It's helping us identify what things audiences like and dislike in our TV shows by analyzing open-ends. .
I like that it saved me a lot of time and that it was really accurate in flagging the responses that should be removed,"can be hard to get started as there are so many capabilities, but the canvs team provides great training &amp; support",It's solving the amount of time that I would spend on open end cleaning. Especially for surveys that have multiple open ends .
"easy to use, comprehensive functionality, makes analyzing open end verbatim or unstructured data significantly quickly",There is no such thing that i dislike about the Canvs but I would like it to work on other types of documents and data,"whenever i have open-ended data from my traditional quant surveys, reading through the responses takes a lot of time and reporting on those themes can be a long task. Canvs helps speed up the process by not only automating the codes &amp; topics, but it also adds emotional sentiment analysis too, for an even deeper view on what my survey results mean. ."
How intuitive the platform is to use and how quickly it delivers the results,"AI is unable to group some codes into the correct nets, for example if a topic may become a code but the positive/negative association to the topic is not included.","Mostly, i analyse all the data gathered. It helps me to determine the key themes and topics and look through each with association to the feelings that people expressed ."
Searching keywords to help make net codes. Interesting to have emotions associated. Ability to change multiple open ends' codes at one time.,Feels a bit hard to navigate even after a few trainings and hours poking around.,Ability to change the codes myself .
Having the themes generated and key insights highlighted has been helpful when parsing through many open ends!,It could use some improvments on the technical side. The interface is good but can be improved.,Cutting down on analysis time so we can spend time better refining insights .
"User-friendly, allows to edit and change tags",Difficult to export data and information,Easily codes open ends and consumer comments .
It's definitely a time saver! I love being able to see the themes at a glance,Sometimes I would describe the UX as a bit clunky and I would like the exports to perhaps be a bit more easy,Qualitative analysis and auto-coding of survey answers .
I like how Canvs AI can aggregate and analyze closed-data with open-ended data. That functionality is very unique.,Customer service was slow to respond and there we often lapses without hearing a response to questions.,Being able to compare closed-ended data to open-ended data .
"Easy to use website tool/interface, speed of analysis",Want the ability to easily add/import/create weights and then export weighted data and coded responses back out for further analysis,Quicker turnaround on large volumes of survey data allow for faster reporting and using data for key business decisions. .
