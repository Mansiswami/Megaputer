Complex and hard to understand for begginers
"As the user of this tool, The initial learning curve associated with configuring fine tune AI Models will be little bit challenging here and we can improve the documentation and more tutorial videos so that users can implement the things very faster. But overall I don't dislike anything about this tool."
"The pricing can be expensive. Watson Assistant is a subscription-based service, and the prices can be high for businesses with large numbers of users. Also, the training data can be challenging to collect."
Price Is still on the steeper side which may lead to convincing a lot of senior management people and get approvals
Shoild have more Sentiment analysis of the human nature
"There is scope of improvement in terms of user guide , they can elaborate the steps which is mentioned. Apart from that its quite good and user friendly. Hoping for better user guide."
"Initially it took some time to get used to it, but once it was understood it was quite good. Demo video can be bit more illustrative it will make the process smooth."
Lack of frequent dialogue templates (client - company)
"To be honest, I don't dislike anything about IBM Watson Assistant. As I said it's fast, easy to use, and super accurate. Since I took the IBM professional data scientist certificate, this is the best tool I have ever used!"
"For users unfamiliar with AI and natural language processing concepts, there can be a learning curve when getting started with IBM Watson Assistant. Understanding intents, and entities, and crafting effective dialog flows might take time, particularly for those new to conversational AI."
"No, I didn't find anything like that. Everything is fine. Solution can go offline mode as well. It will be better if user is provided with scrap websites it has searched."
"For beginners it might be slightly tricky to understand, but the drag and drop functions makes it easy. The accuracy is commendable but there are still slight scope of improvements in terms if repeated answers."
"Sinceramente, não percebi nada que não fosse útil."
I did not find any negative points while using this application.
Alguns problemas de implementação e integração
"Nada a declarar, não foi dito nada que não foi útil."
Faltam detalhes específicos na documentação disponibilizada pela IBM.
Dificuldade em encontrar conteúdos de ensinio e melhoria contínua em português
"The dashboard is good but it's complicated, Also IBM should provide learning support for different channels."
No major downsides. A minor one is - the templates are a little basic - can be sorted in terms of complexity. Will be useful for for new and inexperienced users to choose templates as per their own experience levels.
"I didn't notice any thing , and everything was working well"
"Nada a declarar, a ferramenta é bem prática."
Not so much to be upset with but it can be alittle confusing not having durect connection with other services
"I have not faced any issues with IBM Watson Assistant. They keep on releasing versions frequently, that the issues are fixed before even developers start noticing it."
Everything is good. There is always scope of improvement. It needs to be up to date. Also more people should know about this bot. More people use it more there is chance of improvement.
It can be improved further for more features. Adding new features will increase its usability even more. Few things can be simplified for better understanding.
I would appreciate it more if it is available in multiple languages as well as currently it is only in English. Secondly it could increase rate of data with limited resources so that efficiency is improved
"I have a day job in IT. Most of the topics which I search online are literal string matching. I use the answers to build my own solutions. I will not use watson to create solutions for me, but simply build a foundation. For this reason, it is difficult to use Watson if this is my only usecase."
"I dislike the integration with other top platforms, such as Whatsapp. I wish that there is a ready webhook like the one for Twilio to just hook it to Whatsapp for users with no experience in APIs &amp; integration."
"IBM Watson Assistant is great for creating simple chatbots. However, it can struggle a bit when things start to get complex. Integrating it with third-party apps is tough if they are not directly supported. And the documentation could improve further."
It can improve at some areas such as adding more languages as it just supports English for now also it should process structured data directly and the rate of data as well
"Sometimes the application may work slowly. The bot has webhooks for commonly used platforms, but webhooks for some applications were missing. I am sure that they will add them in future releases."
While using I felt that it is limiting the area of use by keeping it in only one language otherwise it's good one
"There should be a wide range of easy-to-understand tutorials and examples that allows user to build complex chatbots and integrate other IBM Watson services such as Language Translator and Watson Discovery. Currently, there are very few tutorials and a narrow set of examples to explain the capabilities and use cases of IBM Watson Assistant."
Every other problems i faced during working with IBM Watson assistant was solve in their next Updates.
The only thing which can be improved is the Try it panel where we can test the dialog results.
"for some particular case, it does not behave very well"
I felt the downside as it has to improve the intelligent capabilities.Because in my project it is not taking correct values in certain complex scenarios .May be lack of educational domain knowledge
No dislikes. Only thing is need more cources on IBM watson assistant cources.
Industry-specific Intent packs would have been added advantage. One would need a bit of training to understand consumption based billing. Rest is all fine. The platform is easy to configure and maintain.
I don't think more drawbacks on watson. It is the best platform for beginners to learn about chatbot and voice bots. When I start learning about bot this is the most reffered platform.
I feel like they should work on UI design. Rest of all was very nice. I don't find much dislikes in watson assistant
We don't have feature to move the nodes from one skill to other. Need to rebuild it again in the skill.
"Many code samples help learn Watson assistant. However, documentation is not so good when we compare it with AWS. It is taking more time to load it and constantly changing."
"Not much comments on dislikes. It explains everything very easily. Beginners can use this platform with any basic knowledge, this platform giving best way to giving basic knowledge."
"Sometimes there is a delay in the responses. Unless you have committed package offers, it would e difficult to maintain. Works for a general purpose. But needs to improve alot for a long term use."
It's a huge application so it takes time to understand all the concepts of the software.
Nothing! Or maybe just that it's not completely free to be used like most useful products lol but it's totally worth the money.
"The documentation could have been more comprehensive and easy to understand, as we will need good analytical knowledge to understand it. And developer community expertise sharing is limited"
Doesn't processes structured data. Also it can be more affordable
"Natural language and conversational features are not currently multilingual. If that feature is enhanced, it would be a great help."
"Integration options can be improved, user interface can be improved"
"There was language barrier,but hopefully it could be resolved with future updates."
It's creating confusion among the people for Watson products; not good to release multiple products for the same functionality; better to add features for existing products instead of producing various products
Sometimes it becomes un-responsive which I think can be improved
"I believe it can be a steep learning curve for initial users but once that is achieved, this tool is a godsent."
"Its huge platform, its take time to understand all concepts."
"Sometimes it got stuck, otherwise it is nice and good to use while working with conversational flows and chatbots."
Nothing as such to be disliked . The flows between the paths for the conversation in chatbots could have been improved a bit more as an enhancement I would say.
Nothing in my mind at the moment was able to achieve just what i needed.
Nothing as such. More sdk options should be given in order to design chatbots on a larger scale and at convenience.
"Watson Assistant is a little expensive, it seems like their target customer pool is big companies as opposed to smaller companies that actually require a smart chatbot to help since they have a lower staff rate. Another major disadvantage would be the fact that Watson can only be implemented in English. Unfortunately, a lot of people might not be that well versed with English or even technology for that matter."
I would only like more video tutorials available. I find they would be extremely helpful especially when maintaining various bots.
Nothing as such to dislike but it will be beneficial if we have more documentations to refer
There nothing to say about negative.Because there doing there best
Sometimes I have faced lagging issues so that is something that I dislike
The process to train the AI bot was a quite tough.
Training the AI Bot is quite tricky and tedious.
"Well, from a technical perspective, dialogs are easy to be created, but when working with context variables and cross-referencing context variables between nodes or dialogs could be hectic."
It has limited areas of use and only available in English language
"It has resrtiction of language, only available in English"
Handling huge amount of unstructed data is difficult and it can be more affordable
I can be improved by making it more functional in certain languages.
Detection of occulded objects was not that much smooth
"Nothing i disliked, but i would like to see how it works for Indian regional languages."
"It can sometimes not understand difficult accents, and go into a repetitive mode. It can be a tad bit costly."
It could have been more affordable and it takes more time to load and it keeps constantly changing
Some services are discontinued by IBM like the visual recognition engine
It may improve in terms of language connectivity by providing other major language around the globe
It could be featured to use in multiple languages
NLB and machine learning need extra knowledge sharing effort and time.
There's not one that I can think of at the moment.
Nothing specific to mention at this moment
"Computation, the course structures and many more things"
"It is only in English language, can be added more."
Loading the dataset sometimes takes so long. Please improve it.
GUI could be enhanced. It could have been more cheaper.
Integration with python and support for languages like Urdu
It's lacking som e advance functions though like we have some other rivals
"Nothing really. Each app was not helpful for the required business application, but not necessary!"
Data preparation capabilities are too limited and it can be more affordable to use.
The inability to create custom conversational AI bots faster.
There is nothing to dislike IBM Watson. You just need to understand the flow of IBM Watson. You may struggle at initial stage but once you got expertise you will become master.
"As for me, there are not any downsides to IBM Watson Assistant and it is better if you can add more video tutorials in several languages so that users can quickly get it running."
The major challenge we faced is the steep learning curve and more on-call support but eventually all things worked out great in the end. More support on API service is required
I couldn't complete one project with the sessions of that project using apis.
"None, everything is helpful as far as I know"
I am happy with what IBM Watson offered to me!
That it only works while being in the IBM.
What I think is missed here is the amount of technical jargon. Some developers like me want to go deep and the easy to do tutorial can become a hurdle there. Sometimes the whole process is masked under a simple query which becomes harder to understand.
Sometimes misses the context of asked questions
User in creating and understanding working of bots.
"The user interface need a lot of improvement, it's not easy to use for first time users. Also, features should be added for training and modifications of model."
Understanding how to use variables within the assistant was challenging and final formatting is occasionally not consistent with what I think will happen when I use embedded HTML to format responses. Overall though I cannot complain and have ultimately figured out how to make it do what I want.
"I can only think of 1 downside which is that users must develop a good understanding of the different aspects like dialog skills having intents, entities, dialog with nodes, etc. It was a bit confusing at the beginning when there was a bombarding of information, at one point I wasn’t sure of the connection between my assistant and the respective skill I wanted it to have. This was easily remedied after I took one of Coursera’s courses on IBM Watson. There are probably many other videos online as an introduction, so this probably isn’t a huge problem. Perhaps a solution is a tour-style walk through (I’m not sure if it already exists- if so, I probably skipped it)."
There's a bit of a learning curve with the platform's terms. The interface can feel a bit daunting and I would like more readily available and user-friendly help references and tutorials.
Nothing at this time - very contagious with ease of use.
Everything. It is overly complicated and costs way too much
"IBM advertises this as a program that can work for any user, but unless you have experience working with data analytics, it can be difficult to determine where to start."
"I did not recognize any potential issue coming up while making a chatbot, but I may suggest to include a feature where we can save responses to particular questions in a Document, eg Word, PDF or spreadsheet. Apart from this concern, I had a great experience while working on this platform."
"While using IBM watson on a 13.3"" screen, I faced an irritating bug. When I was creating the dialogue flow, as you move the mouse to edit a text, the size of the window changes and many times I accidentally clicked on the cross button thus deleting that particular node. Also, I wish there was dark mode."
"Segregation of Watson and Watson IoT can come to a single PaaS service , it would be easy to link ibm blockchain along with Watson capabilities"
The sys.person feature is so needed for me but it's currently not probably available in the Lite mode. It can somewhat detect the name of a person. It needs some improvements for understanding human names.
Nothing I can think about at the moment.
I didn't disliked anything as such as for me it was a great experience using it.
Teamwork experience can be improved. I'd like to have indicator of the user next to the every node or new intents and entities.
"For starters the beginning might be a bit bumpy, however, that's been taken care off by amazing documentation and step by step tutorials put together by IBM. There is an opportunity to reduce the complexity of the IBM Assistant Documentation for the newbees to make this amazing platform sticky especially with the early adopters."
I don't really have a downside other than certain banks that I am selling to just don't like the impersonal look of a chat bot. Visually it is a little bit blocky and it can be confusing to the user what happens when data is entered as a query and not responded to when asked. The dialogue feature does not recognize any non sensical data.
Can't write custom code and can't be used for heavy projects.
Making link everytime for sharing with friends to show new work.
Less customized (relative to coding the whole thing yourself)
I'd like to see more about what incoming texts are having difficulty being mapped to an intent.
"There are a few things that could be better, like contextual intents and more intelligent entities (like entity parents)"
Would like to have a better voice feature. It would be awesome to have a superfluid voice attached to our Assistant in the future.
"Would love to have it open sourced. Also, would like to more documentation and examples"
I have not seen any thing I dislike yet. All seems well
"Well, in my first time setup in Watson Assistant I feel a little lost when I was searching how to connect with my api it's not clear how to do this things unless read the documentation."
"The challenge comes when chatbot can't handle complex questions, the customers can a times be frustrated."
The auto-hide windows in the dialog because the trash button is always showed
There are really no down side on using Watson except for my difficulty in deploying my assistant on whatsapp. One has to use a 3rd party to deploy on whatsapp.
The fact that support is only better for premium accounts. I already had the experience of using a Standard and unfortunately the support was not done very quickly. This would be a point to be desired and other things could be taken into account to differentiate a premium account.
"The feedback loop is not very intuitive. The learning curve for this may be further simplified to cater to more wider audiences, with more focus on accessibility and human centric design."
Dashboard and analytics can be improved
Nothing so far. One feedback if the user says can be automated using NLP and AI
"Nothing! As a begginer in this technology, it was such an amazing experience and I really hope to work on related projects in a nearly future."
API need to in public as agent in IBM watson
They can provide more analytics on chat data. It can be improved.
The most challenge is understand whats is Intetion and entitie.
There could be an interface to see the http responses back and forth between server and client like how BotFramework Emulator does it. Better for debugging purposes.
Migration process - one automated solution to other. But it not big deal when we moving to get higher benefit..
"how to set up dialogues, the interface could be otherwise."
Only in English (Limits areas of use)
I used for very short time to be able to find dislikes.
Requires lots of training and knowledge.
It’s not for Big files and we can only work on small files with Watson.
"Basic metrics dashboard that includes standard data like in other solutions (Dialogflow, AWS) but still not enough for proper chatbot maintenance"
The only problem I faced was when one of the prebuilt entities was removed and I had to replace it in the flow.
Customization in design and information is something that needs help
The interface should be more user friendly
As of now i dont have any dislike of Watson assistant
There is nothing that bothered me while using the assistant.
Need to add more ai feature add for self learning.
"I liked all ibm waston related products,"
We have been really having a hard time getting our accuracy to required levels because our domain is so big and its hard to maintain the intents. Some examples are almost similar and IBM will find it hard to differentiate the input and match it to the correct intent.
"Honestly, very little. There's really nothing to complain about regarding the Assistant platform itself. I could list some ""nice to haves"" (e.g. more integration with other Watson services like Tone Analyzer, some housekeeping/maintenance features related to intents and entities) but that's just me wanting more cool stuff. Can't even complain about the pricing, which is amazingly fair."
"Bit complex and time consuming, Not so very helpful Chat Bot"
"I didn't find any big drawbacks. Though there is a good course available for learning the basics, but it is really difficult to go through the help materials and not every functionality is well mentioned there. If an advanced course can be provided and an updated one, that would be most helpful."
"Initially this tool is an artificial intelligence, which is going to complement with other applications that handles IBM, in my particular case say something that fogs up excellent innovation, about the work that makes the artificial intelligence would be something out of base and not very ethical."
I didn't like that it has no voice input and it can not recognize voice at all. There are a few YouTube videos only.
"There are no efficient ways to keep up with training evolution, IBM urgently needs to create governance forms for Virtual Assistants, just like Open Scale for predictive models."
"Sometimes IBM does not care very mutch about the continuity of using its API. It does not occur every week, but it changed sometimes with broken compatibility."
We experienced many downs in cloud availability. Maybe IBM should work on his cloud platform stability
"Its menu is a bit confusing, each time I log in I need to search again and again for my dashboard and my services."
Sometimes for a user who traditionally wishes to speak to customer care for help regarding some context interacting with IBM Watson Assistant might seem to be too much time consuming.
Find information about how to pay for the service if I want to contract de service
"Currently incomplete movement from single workspace based, to multiple skills (workspaces) based agents, and from a message based pricing to an active user based pricing model. This is going to get there, but at the the moment the product is somewhere inbetween. I would also like more support for analytics in terms of conversational flow and drop outs, the current strategy of pushing the data out into Watson Studio is incomplete as there aren't easy prebuilt notebooks, or dashboards to build the views you would typically have. So whilst you can do it, there feels like there is a step missing. The ""Premium"" only feature set is very much disliked as it contains things which feel like it should be in the product. Not giving them for a free tier is fine, but even if you pay for standard level they aren't included, instead reserved for a contact only enterprise tier. It makes it impossible to evaluate them properly and means that they don't get the full workout they need to become proper full features."
"Well, I am liking the Watson assistant. I could train the bot over time to accommodate all kind of queries."
"If I say about dislike, I didn't find most but I think if you can make documentation more user familiar then it would be great. As I feel currently documentation is prepared in a way that it only targets experienced users who have prior knowledge in programming."
"I think that Watson Assistant could improve the Analytics tab. User friendly interface to extract the conversation logs in CSV or JSON format. Creating customizable graphics and tables would be very helpfull. Also it would be extra wounderful to measure some especific KPI like Runtime Accuracy, NPS and %Retention. Accordingly i would say that a confusion matrix generator would be kind of cool to help improve the model faster."
"What I dislike much is that there are several errors in the tool that cause dialog flows to get lost, especially when you delete some child node, it simply causes the ""Skip user input and evaluate child nodes"" function to exclude in your dialog"
"My biggest request for improvement is to add an undo button. Although having live changes is great, it's sometimes hard to work with if you make a mistake, break your model, and then have to figure out what you previously did to make it work. I wouild also like the insights page to be improved. We wanted control over history of users and which intents the triggered, as well as a way to capture their feedback, so we implemented a cloudant DB to simply store every conversation. A way to create your own insights dashboard would be very helpful!"
Some System Entities are not available in Japanese.
Process of registration and providing information of deployment application or product . User get little confused at moment as country name not listed
"when you build chatbots you use a lot of examples distributed on diferent Intents, but when you check some conflicts the solution only show 1 vs 1 conflicts, but in the training might exist more than 1 conflictive intentin because the confidence of a test is too low and can be confused, a good solution could be checkin examples across all intents so you can find more conflicts in your training"
Only a little lack of FAQ or instruction for problems directly on ibm platform and not to find on your own elsewhere
"IBM thought in all the details of this application, you can integrate it to all IBM applications, you can register for free to perform short tests, and realize the wonders it offers for customer interaction, and the time you can save, in my opinion nothing negative"
"Can be implemented in flowchart. And sometime it becomes slow. Like when I check the insights, it lags"
The continuous change in design for Watson configuration tool.
"The only thing that could be useful for developers is to rewrite the workspace in the dialog, so that the credentials would be the same. In addition, sometimes the response time is long, especially when trying to launch the tool."
"You need to build your app for the chatbot - and then you need IT experts. This could be done with some low code platform, but indeed is needed some IT knowledge."
"The lack of real integration workflows within Watson platform itself. There`s a orchestrator needed to enable this feature now, but soon they`ll release new versions with this problem addressed."
Ability to move rich data to cloud is big challenge for Fintech companies. This inflexibility hinders the potential that can be tapped from the rich feature sets of Watson. IBM needs to solve data privacy issues working with regulators.
The API to our system was a little complicated.
Would be nice if the business could access the data without needing IT to help extract
"A veces, es un poco lioso el configurar correctamente la comunicación entre un servicio y otro si te sales de lo básico y luego los precios, a mi parecer son un poco elevados. La documentación a veces puede ser un poco confusa y hay que estar pendiente de las versiones que se esté usando y de que estés leyendo la documentación para esa."
"There are still common problems that don't have workable solutions and the community is still pretty small. Specifically, when creating a voice solution with Watson Assistant, the confidence and recognition can be difficult to improve."
Minor issues that seem simple to fix - e.g. you can move training questions to different intents but can't move entity values into different entities.
Multiple outages during last months. Pricing and payment charges not clear enough
I thought that in some point Watson Assistant would be learning by itself
not many coding samples available therefore coding has to be done from scratch in most instances
"There is no ease way to build up over the core of watson assistant, and the support team is not helping."
Nothing to this point with the implementation is a dislike
"I dislike when services sleep and they fall out of sync. This happens when in a Dev env on the lite plan. I also dislike the performance of the name entity which is currently in beta. It is only succesful 50% of the time, my thinking is that this is a staple and should be nailed by now."
I can't think of anything I dislike right now!
I would like to see some of the Myca's features in this api. It'a because the candidate it's the same one that will became an employee
"It takes some training to navigate around the Watson Cloud, probably because it offers so much."
Sometimes updates modify entirelly the apis that we use.
The interface (expecially) working with the dialog nodes can improve although it has been constantly improving.
"Few pre-build models. We had to figure out how to join translation, unstructured text interpretation and communication capabilities."
"The lack of versioning causes us alot of problems, it is also diffiuclt to see what new featurs are planned with Watson Assistant in the furture, for example multiple skills per assistant is apprarently due for release soon but we have no visibility of this, currently we are looking at building applications to manage multiple bots and are not sure whether to invest time in this"
Nothing as such. Commercial discussions including getting an appropriate quote has always been the toughest challenge getting started.
"I really don't dislike anything, every issue I used to have was solved with the UI improvement."
"When it comes to complex intents, there is not many examples out there to follow. It will be nice if IBM can add more case studies."
From a developer perspective the pipeline to manage large amounts of content could be improved.
It should have exhaustive list of utterances for each intent
"Once you grow beyond a single, close-knit team of developers it can be difficult to keep everyone from stepping on toes. Deployment to multiple, separate environments can be tricky."
"Hard to find helpful free training for more complicated features (like Digressions, Javascript modifiers in Dialog Nodes, etc.)"
"The support for common German relative date phrases (like ""uebermorgen"") was difficult. It's difficult for customers to enter time frames instead of concrete times."
THere is nothing that I do not like about this product
still very primitative and need more improvements
Want more integration with other chat and messaging platforms
The biggest oppotunity for the product is the lack of business metrics
I dont like that the interface is so slow.
The integration with Voice Gateway is not easy we had to go through lot of issues
I wish we had the ability to expand the system entities.
I think it could be more easy to track conversations and to insert pickures to the answers.
Watson is heavily dependent on contextual data. It is not always possible to provide all of the data that is required in order to get all of the benefits.
limited tools to help business people to prapare the information needed for training and tools for developpers to test the performances of the clqssifier
Format is a bit generic and feel and look
Distributing user rights once using multiple chatbots is a lot of work. Should be more easy. Also non-technical content writers have difficulty with the interface. More user friendly content writing should be enabled.
The service goes down pretty frequently and no real time support is available
None at this point that is specific to the technology
The delayed that it is taking to use for everyone both company/business and personal use.
I Think it's necessary to improve multy agent system approach
"dev-ops is not there for wA, configuraution is not proper"
"training requires good number utterances, but that is true with any ML platform"
no code locking or integration with git.
Lack of versioning!! The JSON export only goes so far...
"We are still finding a way to manage large sets of trainings, to be sure that training in new issues don;t spoil old ones"
I Believe that the intents part of the assistant should be more friendly
capacidad de integrarlo rapidamente con todo el ecosistema de ibm
Constant upgrades to the interface and sometimes API that require adjustments to keep the solution working properly.
"There are some frequently changing limitations, which makes it hard to build a mutli channel chatbot platform and you have to find workarounds"
Can be enhanced further in the preparation and deployment to equip end user with self service capability.
"adding better lifecycle management, easily administer apps in the cloud, more complex dialog flows require offline code dev"
"Some time, something went wrong. We live in Vietnam thus it's a little bit difficulte to contact IBM WW team"
That it is not integrated in other platforms
"Adoption/learning curve, a ton of opportunities; however currently struggling to establish internal knowledge to grow use cases"
management of content in the graphic user interface
The need for more language support is a necessity.
Probably still at its premise.... would be great to have Watson assistant help for segmentation and contact list behaviour
"Difficult to think of specific examples, so N/A"
I cannot think of anything at this time.
need quicker iterative automatic training
At this time I have not found anything not to like!
it is updated too frequently. this can hinder users from mastering how to use it for configurations
The number of languages is too limited and we need to speed up the development
not being able to combine multiple skils in a single call
Automated utterances for domains should be enhanced to have more variations.
It would be great to see more conversational services built out.
Can be inconsistent sometimes but it really depends
being able to bring in custom learning models
Price of the product and coresponding APIs used are costlier
can be more purpose built for spcific related to ITOps
"The manual nature of importing intents, makes upserting business changes different."
"IBM took a lot of time to identify the right SMEs who can guide us in creating the right training model. Also, there were lot of discussions about leveraging other Watson services such as Discovery, etc, which weren't productive."
"expensive to buy. I wish they has a ""lite"" version"
Still just testing and so far no negatives stick out.
"Fuzzy matching dont works so well in others languages as it does in english, although its still in beta."
Needs feature like ability to do payments via chat.
Unable to do real-time streaming analytics
I do not like how sometimes the AI system spits back data that is not relevant
Documentation for developing conversation applications uses terminology which appears a bit too technical in contrast with the simplicity of configuring the chatbot
The services team did not understand contact center operations. voice automation is not fully developed
"Small catalog of prebuilt solutions, looking for more in future release"
Poor entity extraction. Bluemix is awful to navigate in terms of management. Struggles with large list of trained entities.
